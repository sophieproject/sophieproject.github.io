## Detect Explicit Activity
Sophie's AI works in milliseconds, detecting explicit activity and rating it from 0-5, 0 being not explicit at all and 5 being grossly sexual.

## The Sophie Scale
This is a fair way to measure sexual activity, and we use it in Sophie's AI. <br/>
0: Not sexual at all <br/>
1: Slight flirting <br/>
2: Sexual flirting <br/>
3: More sexual flirting, asking for personal information, etc <br/>
4: Propsitions for sexual activity, sexual roleplay, etc <br/>
5: Acknowledging a minor's age and doing anything from 2-4 <br/>
10: Performing (sextortion)[about://blank] or posting known child-porn sites that are yet to be taken down. <br/>
<br/>
Most users will not reach a level 4 strike.

## Strikes and Records
Your points are *never* exposed to third parties. We rank points in values, such as 1-3 (Minor), 3-6 (Moderate), 6-8 (Suspicious), and 8+ (Severe) <br/>
Teenagers are not given 1 point strikes, we give all teenagers 1 point off of every strike, so flirting doesn't punish the wrong people. <br/>
Records may follow you around the internet, but more times than not, your record will be clean if you are.

## Human Moderation
Sophie's moderators will review all strikes that come through. False-positives are reversed and used to retrain the AI. Extreme strikes (4-5) from an adult may prompt an investigation. We do work with law enforcement.
