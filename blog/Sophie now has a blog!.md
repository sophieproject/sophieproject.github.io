# Sophie now has a blog!
Here we will be posting several updates on how Sophie works, developer material, and generalized conversation about pedophilia/sexual assault and what we plan to do about it.

We have to warn everyone that, obviously, this blog will sometimes go into great depth about sexual assault, and if that makes you uncomfortable, please do not read the posts with the [!] in the front as those are flagged with rape/sexual assault Trigger Warnings.
