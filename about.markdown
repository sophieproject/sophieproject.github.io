# Stopping Pedophiles
Sophie is a nonprofit dedicated to stopping pedophilia online. We will accomplish this by harnessing the power of Tensorflow and our fleet of bots. With these three things, we can detect suspicious activity before it can be damaging.

## Our Technology
Sophie's AI is powered by Google's Tensorflow library. Our artificial intelligence is open-source and publically available for commercial use. Our team is dedicated to updating Artificial Intelligence to ensure the most accurate results.

## Our Methods
Sophie's AI will flag suspicious activity. When this happens, she guesses how sexually explicit the content is. An equation is applied that will penalize adults more severely than teenagers. Next, a notice is sent to deter such behavior.

## Human Moderation
We have a separate team that will review all automated strikes, and if we receive an automatic strike that is not sexually explicit, we remove the strike. However, if the content is sexually explicit, we will monitor the user for further offenses and consider launching an investigation.

# Protecting Children IRL
Stopping a pedophile from meeting with children IRL requires a different approach than our bots. We achieve this by working with law enforcement to get known predators in jail, as automated strikes can provide evidence against a predator. We also serve as a source of information on pedophiles already arrested to help keep your little ones safe from predators they shouldn't come in contact with. 

## Our Knowledgebase
Our knowledge base includes topics such as; coping with PTSD, warning signs of child abuse, and more. Our resources can prove invaluable for parents of abused or groomed children. We provide resources to school counselors to help make their job more effective, and we have endless resources for reporting pedophiles and helplines that may be of use. 

## Hotlines and Lifelines
We provide several links to services that can be invaluable to sexual assault victims. Such resources can be:
- <a href="tel:1-800-273-8255"> The suicide hotline </a>
- <a href="https://rainn.org/about-national-sexual-assault-telephone-hotline"> The sexual assault hotline </a>
