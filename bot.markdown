# Keeping Children Safe
Sophie's Bot is designed to detect explicit activity using Sophie's AI. Our bot will then send us the automated report so that we can decide if it should be sent to law enforcement or not. Learn more about Sophie's AI [here](/ai) and about our privacy [here](/privacy).

## Keeping close watch when moderators can't
Sophie works automatically, so she doesn't need human moderators to sign off on everything she does. We improve her [AI](/ai) every day and we are glad we can. She gets more and more accurate the more people use her, and she can protect everyone when needed.

## Open Source and Free
Sophie is completely open-source, and you can view her code [here](https://github.com/sophieproject/sophiebot).
