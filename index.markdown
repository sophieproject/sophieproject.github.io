## Sophie Bot
Sophie Bot is a brand of bots that all collect ages and usernames, and then uses Sophie's AI to reprimand pedophiles and other creeps that attempt to prey on children. <br/>

## Sophie Extension
Sophie has a web browser extension that is designed like Sophie's bot, and will keep children away from sexual activity on any site they visit. <br/>

## Nonprofit
We don't aim to make a profit off of Sophie, our intentions lie with stopping pedophiles. We don't sell your data to third parties or attempt to flood you with microtransactions or ads, and we never will.

## Privacy
We make Sophie's bots collect the bare minimum required to function. No extra data collection, no passwords, and no creepy data collection. As a matter of fact, this site has **1** cookie, which is used for analytics. We even have a detailed but simple privacy policy. <br/>
