If the answer is yes, you need to proceed to remove that person from both your and your child's life. If you have other children, ensure they are not in contact with that person.<br><br>The second question is: Did your child tell you, or did you find out in some other means? If your child told you, you need to remain calm and have a mature and comforting discussion about it. Do not pin blame, do not defend their attacker, and do not try to slide the conversation. Do not shame them, for either their attack or any depression they may get as a result.<br><br>If you found out by some other means, your child may not be ready to talk about it. Take action behind the scenes by removing the person and contacting law enforcement immediately. Either way, you need to put your child into therapy and contact law enforcement. Have them take 2-3 days off from school (explain to the guidance consular why if you need to, they may be able to provide additional resources and assistance) to calm down and get any help they need.&nbsp;<br><br>Resist the urge to kill the person that assaulted your child, contact law enforcement, and do not shame your child. Read some books on coping with PTSD with them or give them the books, if they are not old enough to read then take advice from their therapist as what to do next.<br><br>From this point on, utilizing the links above will be of great benefit in understanding what your child is going through and how to help. If the attack was online, we urge you to file a report with the Sophie Foundation to help prevent it from happening in other servers or platforms.</p>

                                    Similar to a significant other, your friend may be relying on you. They may reach out to you for help when they have an anxiety attack or a PTSD episode - the best thing for them is to listen to what they have to say during these times, even if it's not exactly what you want to hear. Be understanding and supportive, and it's important to ensure they are comfortable.<br><br>Ask before giving them hugs or touching them, as it can be a trigger. Be generally supportive and hear what they have to say, and things should move along smoothly. It's recommended to lightly push them to go to Law Enforcement if they haven't already, and to get therapy. If they refuse to do either, please respect their wishes.</p>

                                    Understand one thing right now: your significant other needs you right now, and you need to be patient and know the side-effects of PTSD. If it was a recent attack, it is unlikely that your partner will feel comfortable with any sexual activity: and don't push for it either.&nbsp;<br><br>Set up group sessions with a therapist, it may be difficult getting your significant other to talk to a therapist, and your presence may help. If they ask you to leave: do so.<br><br>Watch out for signs of depression or self-harm, do not shame your significant other in any way for what happened. Always ask before touching them in any way, as some motions can trigger a PTSD episode. Read books on coping with PTSD with your significant other, or find other ways to educate each other on coping. Just like them, you are not alone and there are plenty of resources out there. Below, we list some books that are good for people that have a significant other with PTSD: some have audio editions. We recommend reading or listening to them, as knowing how to calm your partner during an episode or not trigger an episode goes a long way.&nbsp;<br><br>Keep in mind if your significant other's attack is distant, some of this may not be relevant: talk to them about it and see what they are comfortable with. Try not to alienate them during this conversation. Be understanding and patient. Your significant other may snap frequently, not want to be touched, etc - this is not personal and is likely the result of a PTSD.<br><br><strong>Books for significant others:</strong><br><a href="https://www.smile.amazon.com/Loving-Someone-PTSD-Understanding-Connecting/dp/1608827860" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Loving someone with PTSD by Aphrodite T.

Make sure they aren't sitting too close to the gender they were attacked by and try to schedule something with Administration (assuming you aren't administration) to make sure the student isn't having any problems with any teachers or staff.<br><br>Set up regular meetings with the student consular or a trained professional, ideally during a break period in their day or class. The parents should already have knowledge of the attack, however if they aren't then ensure they know. It is best to keep meetings with the consular and the student confidential, as notifying the parents of any non-alarming behavior will have the student clam up and not want to talk.<br><br>The guidance consular should be aware that any information they give to the parents can make the child no longer want to speak of their assault, and this can result in a long-term mistrust of authority as well as consulars and therapists. If you believe the child is suicidal, it is best to notify the parents, as well as talk the child down. Remember: you don't always know the child's living situation, their parents may shame or guilt them for being suicidal and/or attacked. It is not uncommon, and keeping trust with the child is crucial.<br><br>Also, avoid showing the student any videos on "Stranger Danger", "Staying safe online", or other videos on teaching them to prevent sexual assault. This can trigger a PTSD episode and is generally not recommended. No, seriously, schools have forced children with a PTSD to learn how to avoid a situation they've already been in, it's sad and please don't do it.</p>

                                    First things first: Your employee may have several emotional breakdowns or may snap at fellow co-workers. It is important to understand the effects of PTSD and how damaging they can be: anything at any given moment can feel very real.<br><br>If the employee was not assaulted by a co-worker, the best thing to do is to arrange a meeting with HR and the employee to ensure the employee feels comfortable in their current workplace. Avoid making their direct superior the same gender they were attacked by, if possible, and take any reports of hazing and assault carefully as someone that has already been assaulted is more likely to be assaulted again.<br><br>If the employee was assaulted by a co-worker, you need to take the report very seriously. Follow your organization's protocol (typically this is a form of involving law enforcement and ensuring both employee's comfort until a investigation has concluded) and you need to follow the steps from the second paragraph: ensuring the employee's comfort in their working situation and avoid making their direct superior the same gender they were attacked by. It is very critical to involve law enforcement if you haven't already, as withholding such information from law enforcement is a felony in some countries.</p>
