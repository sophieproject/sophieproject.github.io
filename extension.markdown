# How it works
 Sophie's Extension will send bricks of text to Sophie's AI, without a user header. Sophie's AI will then define how sexual that text is. If it is above the allowed level (default is 2) then the text is blocked.

## Smart Parental Controls
 This is an AI-powered parental control extension, which means instead of blocking entire sites, like Twitter, it will block only the bad parts of those sites. This is ideal to moderate your child's activity while giving them more freedom. Sites that are designed to be NSFW, such as porn sites, are blocked altogether.

## Get it
The extension is still awaiting posting on the Chrome Web Store, and a Firefox plug-in is under development. <br/>
